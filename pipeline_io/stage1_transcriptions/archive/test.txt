Im feeling rather rotten so im not very ambitious right now Honestly, it's just one of those days where everything feels a bit more intense than usual. I've been thinking about it a lot, and emotions like this don’t just come out of nowhere. The words I say might sound simple, but there’s always something deeper going on beneath them. Sometimes I wish things could just be a bit easier, but this is what it is right now. I'm trying to cope, understand, and move forward. It's like my heart and my thoughts are in a constant conversation, never settling.
